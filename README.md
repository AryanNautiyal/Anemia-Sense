# Anemia-Sense
<h4><p>Anemia Sense uses machine learning to predict whether a person has anemia based on key blood indicators such as MCHC, MCH, MCV, hemoglobin levels and gender.<br>
This tool helps in early detection by analyzing these metrics to classify anemia presence.</p></h4>
<br>

<h1><bold>Features:</bold></h1>
<h4><p>- Machine learning-based prediction model.<br>
- Analyzes MCHC, MCH, MCV, hemoglobin and gender to determine anemia risk.<br>
- User-friendly interface to input blood test data and recieve predictions.</p></h4>
<br>

<h1><bold>Technologies Used:</bold></h1>
<h4><p>- scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)<br>
- Flask (for backend)<br>
- Html, CSS (for frontend)<br>
- Pandas (for data analysis and data manipulation)<br>
- Numpy (used to handle and structure the user-input data into arrays for feeding into the machine learning model for prediction)<br>
- Matplotlib (data visualization)<br>
- Seaborn (advanced data visualization)<br>
- Joblib (for making pickle file and saving model)</p></h4>


<h4>Process for model:<br></h4>
<h5>Step 1: Use Model.ipynb file in google collab.<br>
Step 2: Execute all the code in cells in the collab file and download the file by joblib.<br>
Step 3: Use the joblib file instead of model.joblib in model folder.</h5>
